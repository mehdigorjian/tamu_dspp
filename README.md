# DSPP app

A teamwork project (comprised of 6 people) at Texas A&M University to help Bryan/College Station Schools to collect students data and predict their progress in specific course.

The project was a development on a legacy project based on a Scikit-learn predictor tool which was developed by our team in Python utilizing Django framework for backend, and also improving the front end using CSS with Bootstrap.
